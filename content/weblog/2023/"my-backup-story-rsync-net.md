For years, I've been the self-appointed guardian of my family's digital treasures, diligently backing up everything on trusty 128 GB SanDisk USBs. You name it, from family photos to important documents, it was all meticulously stored on those little drives. But here's the kicker: I wanted a cloud solution, something that could offer the same level of security and accessibility without breaking the bank.

I scoured the internet for options, but to be honest, most cloud services were way out of my budget range. Sure, they boasted top-notch security, but they lacked the flexibility and affordability I needed. I mean, come on, a budget-conscious student like me couldn't justify shelling out big bucks for a rigid, overpriced cloud service that didn't quite fit the bill.

Then my friend [Pirate Praveen](https://social.masto.host/@praveen) suggested [rsync.net](https://rsync.net).

It was like finding a hidden gem in a sea of overpriced clouds.

So basically, Rsync.net is a cloud storage service that stands out for its emphasis on privacy, data security, and flexibility. Essentially, it provides users with an empty UNIX filesystem accessible through various SSH tools, built on the reliable ZFS file system known for it's fault tolerance. This platform allows users to execute a range of backup operations, including rsync, sftp, scp, borg, rclone, restic, and git-annex, making it a versatile and comprehensive solution for a wide array of backup needs.

Oh, and get this: I told them I was a broke student, and they totally hooked me up! They offered me a sweet educational discount rate of just 0.6 cents per GB, per month. Sure, I had to pay annually, but with a 250 GB minimum, it's only 18 bucks a year. Talk about a steal! As a student, every penny counts, and this was simply awesome.

And they have a really quick support team. Most queries get resolved within minutes or max 24 hrs. When I was struggling with sluggish upload and download speeds, these legends didn't waste a second. They set me up with test accounts all over the globe to figure out which spot had the smoothest routes to my place.

So yeah, https://rsync.net is a huge thumbs up :)
