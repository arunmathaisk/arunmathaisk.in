I would like to believe that I genuinely value the Libre Software principles, ethics, and the whole ecosystem around it. And on the other hand, I do not like nor agree with the business and ethical practices of these huge corporate companies.

But with certain choices, there come certain sacrifices as well. The term 'sacrifices' here can be put to debate but, you get the point...

So, as an undergraduate student Bacheloring in Computer Engineering, I am displayed with several job offerings from fortune 500 tech companies, several "open source" projects, some campaigns, and other community/developer advocacy programs that would require me to speak something pleasant about their products and services in exchange of possible recognition or compensation in the form of swags, money or other resources...

Now, generally speaking, all this might sound cool and one might end up taking these offers, using them to their maximum potential, and hopefully would have established a decent career profile over their next 10 years.

The real question I battle with is... am I using my Libre software spirit to not participate in these corporate-funded activities or is it that in reality, I think I am not competent enough to shine out there in the corporate tech world and thus am kind of putting my incompetence under the carpet.

I mean when I see people I know get placed in such firms and land themselves a pretty lucrative salary..., I start to question my ideals. But after a few minutes of thought, I conclude that "no I think I am standing for the right cause".

Now having said all that, one can not survive without money..., so this is what I plan on doing...

Do what I feel is right even if that means I don't make a lot of money.
If things go bad and I am no longer in a position to afford my lifestyle.., I leave everything and work for these huge corporates hoping it is not too late by then :).
