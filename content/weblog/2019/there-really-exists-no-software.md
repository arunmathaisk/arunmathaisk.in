When I was a small child I used to wonder how computer storage worked and like how I used to click on the delete button and the computer would delete the files magically for me.

I always compared a computer to an actual human and the fact that you could delete files on demand got me crazy cause as a human I could never do that and neither can i do it now.

As a child I never quite understood how memory devices work and like how it's literally just atoms arranged in a particular position that represents a bit.

To be honest after I learnt what a bit is and how it can be manipulated and stored… it was like a recursive flashback, my brain trying to make sense of all the conceptual gap and magic that I could not connect all that while.

The fact that there really is no software is so fascinating.

Like when we write software .. we are actually just causing hardware to make changes to hardware.

I mean if we ask ourselves..What is actually a program or a software?

Well..,It is just bits arranged in a particular order.Thats it.

So basically if I have a program that prints out "hello world" and lets say takes the size of 3Kb on disk.

Technially without knowing how to program,, if I am able to arrange those 3Kb worth of bits in the right order,I could essentially reproduce the same program.

Now that I think, if I want to make the world's best compression algorithm…,Technially all I need to do is arrange the bits in the right order.

Well I have no clue about the permutations and the combinations that can take place but just as a mere thought it's fascinating how we can create marvel by just arranging a few bits in the right order.
