I spend an embarrassing amount of time in cafes, though honestly, I like the whole concept of a cafe way more than the coffee itself.
I know it’s a bit like going to a bar for the water, but the caffeine isn't really the draw for me. I’m just there for the faces.

I’ve been staying alone in Mumbai/Thane for almost two years now.
My social life is pretty much non existent by choice, I guess, but let’s not digress into the why of it all right now.

The point is, I love the ambience.

When I’m tucked away in a corner of a cafe, I don’t feel so lonely; it feels like a safe space.
I get to observe so many great personalities, some eventually become "regulars", some I see every six months, while others just remain figments of my imagination.

I don’t know, man. I just like spending 5 to 6 hours with my laptop, expertly pretending to work. Once in a while, I actually do get some stuff done, but mostly I’m just there for the environment.

At this point, I’m basically part of the furniture (LMAO), and I’m on a first name basis with the staff.

Blue Tokai is the winner for me so far. It helps that there’s a branch barely a kilometer away from my place and the wifi actually holds up.
Since I'm not there for the beans, I usually just go for their hot chocolate.

My credit card statement is the only thing side eyeing my choices right now.
But hey, if the price of feeling 'kinda happy' is a daily hot chocolate, I think I’m fine with the trade off.
