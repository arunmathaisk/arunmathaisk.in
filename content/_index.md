Hello, everyone! 👋

I'm **Arun Mathai S.K.**

I consider myself to be somewhat of a tinkerer.

Things simply fascinate me and the human brain is something I really admire .

Here are some of the things I like.

[Computers, Programming, Internet, Food, Music, Science, Movies & TV-Shows].

Just like any other obedient zombie out there, I know right 👀.

I don't really understand art, and by that I mean poems and paintings, but I think I am making progress.

Basically, I’m just a guy "tying" to make a positive impact on society with the limited knowledge I have. I wholeheartedly believe that even the smallest contribution has the power to bring about meaningful change. I know it may sound cliché, but I truly believe in the collective strength of individual actions.

So yeah that's all about me. 😄

If you still wanna know more about me, simply send across a “Hi!”.

I mostly go by @arunmathaisk on the internets.
