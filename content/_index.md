Hello, everyone! 👋

I'm Arun Mathai.

I consider myself to be somewhat of a tinkerer.

Things simply fascinate me and the human brain is something I really admire .

Here are some of the things I like.

[Computers, Programming, Internet, Food, Music, Science, Movies & TV-Shows].

Just like any other obedient zombie out there, I know right 👀.

If you still wanna know more about me, simply send across a “Hi!”.

I mostly go by @arunmathaisk on the internets.
