      <description>Imposter syndrome, a struggle experienced by many, has been a constant presence in my life. Despite my coding skills and technical knowledge, there are times when I can&amp;rsquo;t help but feel like a fraud, merely faking my way through. But I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realize that imposter syndrome is a common phenomenon, and I am not alone in this battle. Through self-reflection and embracing my true abilities, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to navigate these feelings and grow both personally and professionally.</description>

      <description>I would like to believe that I genuinely value the Libre Software principles, ethics, and the whole ecosystem around it. And on the other hand, I do not like nor agree with the business and ethical practices of these huge corporate companies.
But with certain choices, there come certain sacrifices as well. The term &amp;lsquo;sacrifices&amp;rsquo; here can be put to debate but, you get the point&amp;hellip;
So, as an undergraduate student Bacheloring in Computer Engineering, I am displayed with several job offerings from fortune 500 tech companies, several &amp;ldquo;open source&amp;rdquo; projects, some campaigns, and other community/developer advocacy programs that would require me to speak something pleasant about their products and services in exchange of possible recognition or compensation in the form of swags, money or other resources&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>Why I love healthy communities</title>

      <description>Having a community where you can discuss your ideas, talk with people who have similar ideologies or with people who
have ideolgies poles apart from what you have is truly a privilege.
A safe and healthly community is a perfect place for growth.
For me this was and is FSCI(Free Software Community India) and hopefully will continue to be one in the future.
FSCI is just not about tech and liberation, I feel it is actually about the people.</description>

      <title>Does a soul exist?</title>

      <description>I mean all that comes to my mind when I think about the word “soul” is the vague figure of a spirit. (As shown in a few movies)
Other questions which pop up in my mind are:
Is a spirit and a soul the same? And if a soul exists, then where does it reside?
And can a soul be sentient/intelligent/self-aware, If yes then how is it able to think without a brain?</description>

      <description>When I was a small child I used to wonder how computer storage worked and like how I used to click on the delete button and the computer would delete the files magically for me.
I always compared a computer to an actual human and the fact that you could delete files on demand got me crazy cause as a human I could never do that and neither can i do it now.</description>
