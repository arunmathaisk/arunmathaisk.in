      <description>I know, I know the title really does not make much sense, but try to get the vibe. I started using computers quite early in my life.My first machine was a sturdy HP-Windows XP Box .
I never really cared back then about privacy and stuff, for I even did not even know what privacy meant. In fact, I really was not even bothered with surveillance and stuff for quite a major portion of my teenage life.</description>
