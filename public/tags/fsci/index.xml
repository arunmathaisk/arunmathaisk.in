      <description>Having a community where you can discuss your ideas, talk with people who have similar ideologies or with people who
have ideolgies poles apart from what you have is truly a privilege.
A safe and healthly community is a perfect place for growth.
For me this was and is FSCI(Free Software Community India) and hopefully will continue to be one in the future.
FSCI is just not about tech and liberation, I feel it is actually about the people.</description>
