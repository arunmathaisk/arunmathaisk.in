      <description>When I was a small child I used to wonder how computer storage worked and like how I used to click on the delete button and the computer would delete the files magically for me.
I always compared a computer to an actual human and the fact that you could delete files on demand got me crazy cause as a human I could never do that and neither can i do it now.</description>
